name: component-test-design
description: Designs Cypress tests for one React component or one page as a table a human approves, from the component's props, docs/PRODUCT.md and docs/APP-MAP.md, before any test code exists. Use when the user asks what to test in a component or a page, asks for component tests, UI states, edge cases, or test ideas for the Fernly UI. Writes web/cypress/test-design/<Name>.md and stops for approval. Do NOT use to write test code — that is the cypress-test-writer subagent.

# Component test design

1. **Component:** read its props in `web/src/components` and where it's used. **Page:** read its API calls in `docs/APP-MAP.md`. Also use `docs/PRODUCT.md` for expected behavior.

2. **One table:** ID | kind (render / state / interaction / boundary / accessibility, or for a page: positive / negative / edge) | given (props, or the API answer) | the user does | expected | source (a PRODUCT.md line, or "the component's purpose") | technique.

   Write the table to `web/cypress/test-design/<Name>.md` (`<Name>` = component or page name).

3. **Techniques**, named in their column: equivalence classes over each prop; boundaries (0, 1, the limit, one past it); states (disabled, loading, empty, error); callbacks (called with what); accessibility basics (every control has a role and a name).

4. A **page** gets at least: a normal answer, an empty answer, an error (500), signed out (401), and an extreme value (a very long name, price 0, a slow answer).

5. What no document says: a row marked `assumed — ask`, with no expected result.

6. **Stop.** Show the table and wait for "approved" or changes. Write no test code.

After approval, test implementation is for the **cypress-test-writer** subagent — not this skill.
